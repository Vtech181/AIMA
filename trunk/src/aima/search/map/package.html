<p>This package contains classes which are useful to create
map agents. The contained <code>MapWithSLD</code> class extends
the original <code>aima.search.map.Map</code> by features
such as location coordinates and straight-line distances.
Adaptable heuristic functions let the agent modify the
heuristic function with respect to the current goal. Standardized
dynamic attribute names make information exchange between environment
and agent safer without introducing direct dependencies.
