<p>This package contains classes, which are useful to create
map agents. The contained <code>Map</code> class maintains
named locations with coordinates, links between them, and
straight-line distances. The <code>MapEnvironment</code>
enables a <code>MapAgent</code> to travel trough a world
whose topology is described by a map.
Adaptable heuristic functions let the agent modify the
heuristic function with respect to the current goal. Standardized
dynamic attribute names in class <code>DynAttributeNames</code>
make information exchange between environment
and agent a bit safer without introducing direct dependencies.
