<p>This package together with its sub-packages contain a simple
tool for viewing Open Street Map data. The OSM viewer is designed
as a general purpose viewer which is highly configurable and extendible.
The internal representation is chosen as close as possible to the original
OSM file. Classification and abstraction lies in the responsibility
of the renderer. A rather general renderer implementation is included,
which is based on declarative rendering rules.</p>

<p>Routing functionality is based on the AIMA-JAVA core library.
All dependencies to the core library are encapsulated in the routing
sub-package and the applications using functionality from that package.
So the viewer classes can also be used as stand-alone library
for building general OSM applications.</p>

<p> In the current version, relation entities are ignored and
the size of the map should be limited to about a million nodes
to avoid long loading times. The tool Osmosis can be used to generate
maps complying to this requirement.</p>

<p> If no map is displayed, make sure that the main/resource folder is included in 
the build path of your project, recompile and start again.
Then place the mouse inside the map viewer pane. Try Mouse-Left, Mouse-Right,
Mouse-Drag, Ctrl-Mouse-Left, Plus button, Minus button, Ctrl-Plus, Ctrl-Minus,
arrow buttons, and also the Mouse-Wheel for navigation,
mark setting, and track definition. Before routing, at least two marks
must be set!</p>
