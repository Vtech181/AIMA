#Getting started using the AIMA-Java projects.

= Setting up your workspace =
The latest release can be downloaded as a single compressed .zip file, from the project's download page: 
  * http://code.google.com/p/aima-java/downloads/list
  
Alternatively you can check out from the project's Subversion repository directly. For this you will require a Subversion client, see the following for useful instructions:
  * http://code.google.com/p/aima-java/source/checkout
  * http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html
  
Once you've setup your workspace, the directory structure should be organized in the following manner:
{{{
<your-workspace-directory>/
    aima-core/
    aima-gui/
    aimax-osm/
}}}

*Note:* There is also an _aima-all_ project but you may ignore this as it is intended to only be used by the project's developers for creating releases and Java Web Start applications.

The _aima-core_ project is the baseline project that contains all the current implementations for the algorithms described in AIMA3e. It only depends on having a <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java Development Kit(JDK) 1.6</a> installed locally, if you want to edit/compile the provided Java files (.jar files including compiled .class files are provided with the releases). For testing, the _aima-core_ project is also dependent on <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> for running its test suite, the required library .jar file is included in the projects /lib directory. The _aima-gui_ depends on _aima-core_ and contains example GUI and command line demonstrations of the algorithms defined in _aima-core_. The _aimax-osm_ project is an extension project that demonstrates how the core algorithms can be used to create Navigation Applications using map data provided by the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Maps</a> project.

The following instructions detail how to work with the provided projects via the command line using the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> build system or by using the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse IDE</a>.

== Using the Command Line and <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> ==

ensure that your Windows PATH
environment variable contains the directory where your JDK's bin is, e.g.:

C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0\bin

== Using the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse IDE</a> ==
*Note:* You do not need to use the provided <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> build.xml files if you are using the Eclipse IDE.

=== Importing a downloaded release ===
Extract the contents of the downloaded .zip file to a local directory from which you wish to work, for e.g.: 

C:/Temp/AIMA/

Then from within Eclipse, import the extracted projects to your workspace as follows:
  # Select the menu item 'File->Import...'<br> http://aima-java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/aima-all/release/wiki/eclipse_file_import.png
  # In the Import 'Select' dialog, select 'General->Existing Projects into Workspace':<br> http://aima-java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/aima-all/release/wiki/eclipse_import_existing.png
  # In the Import 'Import Projects' dialog enter the location where you extracted the projects (e.g. C:/Temp/AIMA):<br> http://aima-java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/aima-all/release/wiki/eclipse_import_projects.png <br> The three projects, _aima-core_, _aima-gui_, and _aimax-osm_ should be listed and be automatically selected.
  # Hit the 'Finish' button.
 
=== Using the Subversion repository directly ===
*Note:* The <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">Subclipse</a> Subversion client is a useful plugin for the Eclipse IDE. Refer to http://subclipse.tigris.org/ for details on how to setup your Eclipse IDE to use the plugin. The following instructions detail how to download the AIMA-Java project using this plugin. 

  # Select the menu item 'File->New->Other':<br> http://aima-java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/aima-all/release/wiki/eclipse_new_other.png
  # In the New 'Select a wizard' dialog, select 'SVN->Checkout Projects from SVN':<br> http://aima-java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/aima-all/release/wiki/eclipse_new_other_svn.png
  # Hit the 'Next >' button.
  # If this is your first time accessing the AIMA-Java Subversion repository you will want to select 'Create a new repository location' and hit the 'Next >' button otherwise just enter in the pre-existing location from the list provided.
    # In the 'Select/Create Location' dialog, enter the following location:<br> http://aima-java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/aima-all/release/wiki/eclipse_svn_create_location.png <br> and then hit the 'Next >' button to complete setting up the location.  
  # In the 'Select Folder' dialog, select the project you wish to download to your local workspace, starting with _aima-core_, for e.g.:<br> http://aima-java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/aima-all/release/wiki/eclipse_select_new_project.png
  # You may now hit the 'Finish' button and the project should be downloaded to your local Eclipse workspace.

*WARNING* If you have multiple Subversion clients installed locally, do not mix and match their usage within a single workspace, as it can often corrupt your local workspace due to incompatible local meta-data usage between the different clients. 

Once you've setup the AIMA-Java projects in your Eclipse workspace, it should look something like this:<br>

== Running Test and Programs ==

aima.test.core.unit.AllAIMAUnitTestSuite


For programs, you'll need to look in the aima-gui project, which has GUIs
and command line demos that you can run, e.g.:

aima.gui.demo.search.EightPuzzleDemo

just ensure the .java you open has a:

public static void main(String[] args) {
