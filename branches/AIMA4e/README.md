## TODO (REMEMBER - KEEP IT SIMPLE SIMPLE SIMPLE!!!! :)
### CURRENT (new demo GUI)


### LATER

#### Chapter 3 'core' module.
* Uniform-Cost-Search need a better mechanism for determining state containment in the
  queue and remove a node with a higher state cost.
* Consider making the Frontier and Prirority queues into their own classes.
* Recursive-Best-First-Search - look to improve/tidy up implementation.
* BasicRecursiveBestFirstSearchTest
* 3 	92	Best-First search
* 3 	92	Greedy best-First search
* 3 	93	A* search
* 3 	90	Bidirectional search
* BasicIterativeDeepeningSearchTest
* BasicDepthLimitedSearchTest
* BasicDepthFirstSearchTest
* BasicUniformCostSearchTest
* BreadthFirstSearchTest - additional tests.
* BasicGraphSearchTest
* BasicTreeSearchTest
* BasicProblemTest
* BasicSimpleProblemSolvingAgentTest
* 3.2 	68	Romania

#### Chapter 2 'core' module.
* BasicModelBasedReflexAgentTest
* BasicTableDrivenAgentTest

#### Chapter 2 'extra' module.
* Environment defintion: Consider specifying Dimensions in API, see pg. 42.
* Environment Simulator referenced on pg. 45 (this will be a refactor of the a lot of the environment stuff
  in aima3e-core).
